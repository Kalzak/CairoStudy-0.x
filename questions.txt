Why is memory immutable? What was the reason?

What is the point of specifically defining a constant? Because memory is immutable anyways?
  Is it just for readability to show that some particular variable will never change?
  What I mean to ask if what's the low-level difference between...
    `let (array_size) = 3`
      and...
    `const ARRAY_SIZE = 3`
